  🔭 I'm currently working on building a showcase, as most of my previous projects and collaborations were in private organizational repositories, requiring confidentiality and security.  🔭

  🐍 Right now I'm building a blog application and a trading wallet app using **Flask** and **Python** 🐍

  ☕️ With some coffee on I'm going to build some apps with Java and Spring Boot ☕️
  
  🌱 My next steps are learning **AWS, Kubernetes, RabbitMQ and Kafka** 🌱
  
  🔴 I’m looking to collaborate on **Scala projects** in the near future 🔴

  📚 My upcoming reads include 'Building Microservices' by Sam Newman and 'The Pragmatic Programmer' by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas, delving into software development insights and best practices. 📚
